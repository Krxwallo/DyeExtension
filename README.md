# Dye Extension

This mod tries  to make dyes a bit more attractive by adding more possibilities to do stuff with dyes. Dye Extension adds dyed blocks like dyed andesite, dyed cobblestone or leaves. It also adds some stairs and slabs variants like dyed andesite stairs/slabs or dyed stone stairs/slabs. In addition, there are crafting recipes for dyed sticks and with those dyed sticks you can then craft lots of tools with dyed handles.
